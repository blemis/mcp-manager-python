# Resume Instructions for Next Session

## üöÄ **EXACT MESSAGE TO START NEXT SESSION**

Copy and paste this exact message to resume efficiently:

---

**"I'm resuming development on the MCP Manager project. Please read the CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md and PLAN.md files to understand the current state. The AI-driven MCP suite curation engine is complete (80% total progress). I need to continue with the next priority tasks:

1. Implement missing CLI commands (analytics summary, analytics query, tools search, tools list)
2. Create task-specific configuration system for automated multi-MCP workflows  
3. Fix Docker Desktop tool discovery showing 0 tools

Please start by reading the continuation guide and confirming you understand the current architecture and next steps."**

---

## üìã **WHAT TO EXPECT**

The AI assistant will:

1. **Read CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md** - Get all architectural patterns and development techniques
2. **Read PLAN.md** - Understand current status and project roadmap  
3. **Confirm understanding** - Acknowledge the AI curation system completion
4. **Start immediately** - Begin implementing missing CLI commands using established patterns

## üéØ **FIRST TASKS TO ASSIGN**

After the AI confirms understanding, assign tasks in this order:

### **Task 1: Analytics CLI Commands**
*"Implement the missing analytics CLI commands using the existing UsageAnalyticsService. Add `mcp-manager analytics summary` and `mcp-manager analytics query` commands following the established CLI patterns in the continuation guide."*

### **Task 2: Tools CLI Commands**  
*"Implement the missing tools CLI commands using the existing ToolRegistryService. Add `mcp-manager tools search <query>` and `mcp-manager tools list` commands with rich formatted output."*

### **Task 3: Docker Desktop Tool Discovery Fix**
*"Fix the Docker Desktop tool discovery issue where servers show 0 tools. The problem is in the tool discovery process - investigate and fix the curl server tool enumeration."*

### **Task 4: Task-Specific Configuration System**
*"Create the WorkflowManager system for automated multi-MCP workflows. This should enable suite-based server activation/deactivation and task switching using the AI-curated suites."*

## ‚ö° **KEY CONTEXT TO PROVIDE**

If the AI needs clarification, provide these key facts:

### **Project Status**
- **80% complete** with AI curation engine fully implemented
- **All core systems working**: database, AI config, suite management, CLI framework
- **Next phase**: Complete missing CLI commands and task-specific automation

### **Architecture Facts** 
- Database path: `config.database_path` (property exists in Config class)
- CLI patterns: Always use `@handle_errors` decorator and `asyncio.run()` for async operations
- Import pattern: Import heavy modules inside CLI functions, not at module level
- All credentials stored encrypted using keyring + cryptography

### **Working Systems**
- `UsageAnalyticsService` - Ready for analytics CLI commands
- `ToolRegistryService` - Ready for tools CLI commands  
- `ai_curation_engine` - Complete AI system with server analysis
- `suite_manager` - Complete database-backed suite management
- Rich console framework - All output uses rich formatting

## üö® **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

For the session to be productive, ensure the AI:

1. **Reads the guides first** - Don't start coding until the continuation guide is read
2. **Uses established patterns** - Follow the proven techniques documented
3. **Implements incrementally** - One command at a time, test as you go
4. **Commits frequently** - After each working command or feature
5. **Maintains quality** - Use error handling, rich output, proper logging

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

If the AI seems confused or starts from scratch:

### **Redirect with Context**
*"Please read CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md first. The project is 80% complete with all major systems implemented. I need you to use the existing services and patterns, not rebuild anything."*

### **Key File Reference**
*"The analytics service is in `src/mcp_manager/analytics/usage_analytics.py` and tool registry is in `src/mcp_manager/core/tool_registry.py`. Use these existing services for the CLI commands."*

### **Pattern Reminder**
*"Follow the CLI patterns in the continuation guide. All commands need `@handle_errors` decorator and should import dependencies inside the function."*

## üìä **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know the session is on track when:

‚úÖ AI reads and acknowledges the continuation guide  
‚úÖ AI understands the 80% completion status  
‚úÖ AI starts implementing using existing services  
‚úÖ AI follows established CLI patterns  
‚úÖ Commands work and produce rich formatted output  
‚úÖ Commits are made after each working feature  

## üéØ **SESSION GOAL**

By end of session, achieve:
- **Analytics CLI commands working** (`summary`, `query`)
- **Tools CLI commands working** (`search`, `list`)  
- **Docker Desktop tool discovery fixed**
- **Progress toward 85-90% project completion**
- **All implementations following established patterns**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RED FLAGS**

Stop and redirect if the AI:
- Starts rebuilding existing systems
- Doesn't read the continuation guide
- Uses different patterns than documented
- Creates new database schemas
- Implements features that already exist

**The key is making sure the AI understands this is continuation, not starting fresh!**
