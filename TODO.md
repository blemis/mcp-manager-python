# TODO.md - MCP Manager Python Project

## Project Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅

The MCP Manager is now feature-complete and production-ready with comprehensive external change detection and synchronization capabilities.

## Completed Features

### Core Management
✅ Server discovery and installation across all MCP types (Docker Desktop, NPM, Docker Hub, Custom)  
✅ Unique Install ID system for distinguishing servers with same names  
✅ One-command installation with `install-package` command  
✅ Comprehensive Docker Desktop MCP integration  
✅ Advanced duplicate detection and cleanup capabilities  

### External Change Detection & Synchronization
✅ **Complete external change detection system using `claude mcp list` as source of truth**  
✅ **Automatic synchronization with external MCP configuration changes**  
✅ **Sync loop protection to prevent infinite loops during operations**  
✅ **Proper docker-gateway parsing to handle individual servers within the gateway**  
✅ Interactive and automatic synchronization modes  
✅ Background monitoring service with auto-sync capabilities  
✅ Real-time change detection with watch mode  

### User Interfaces
✅ Rich-based CLI with comprehensive command set  
✅ Multiple TUI options (Rich menu, Textual, Simple)  
✅ Interactive menu system for easy server management  
✅ Comprehensive help system and error handling  

### Architecture & Quality
✅ Production-level modular architecture with clean separation of concerns  
✅ Comprehensive error handling and structured logging throughout  
✅ Type safety with full type hints and Pydantic validation  
✅ Unit and integration test coverage  
✅ Security best practices (no hardcoded secrets, proper input validation)  

## Architecture Overview

The system uses Claude Code's internal state (`~/.claude.json`) as the source of truth, managed by `claude mcp` commands. The manager provides:

- **SimpleMCPManager**: Main management class with sync loop protection
- **Change Detection**: Monitors external changes and provides synchronization
- **Discovery System**: Multi-source server discovery with quality scoring
- **Background Monitor**: Continuous monitoring with configurable auto-sync
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, TUI, and interactive menu options

## Configuration

The tool uses hierarchical configuration:
1. System: `/etc/mcp-manager/config.toml`
2. User: `~/.config/mcp-manager/config.toml`  
3. Project: `./.mcp-manager.toml`
4. Environment: `MCP_MANAGER_*` variables

## Usage

```bash
# Discovery and installation
mcp-manager discover --query filesystem
mcp-manager install-package dd-SQLite

# External change synchronization
mcp-manager sync                    # Interactive sync
mcp-manager sync --auto-apply      # Automatic sync
mcp-manager detect-changes --watch # Monitor changes

# Background monitoring
mcp-manager monitor --start --auto-sync

# Interactive interfaces
mcp-manager                        # Interactive menu (default)
mcp-manager tui                    # Rich TUI interface
```

The project is complete and ready for production use.
